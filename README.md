# Music-Application
This is my 4th year final project for college. It is a python desktop application.
The application allows a user to record a piece of music with their guitar.
The recording is saved as a WAV file that the user can listen to as it is saved to their computer.
The application uses the audio data from the WAV file and transcribes the music.
The user can view their piece of music in written form.

The application is based on the PyAudio and Numpy tools.

It uses the FFT to transcribe the music.
